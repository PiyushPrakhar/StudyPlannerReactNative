         <b>1. WHAT IS AI PLANNER ?</b>\n\n

        So how do we plan to study for exams when we have limited time?\n\n

        Most of us find the total number of days left and the total number of subjects that we have to study. Then, we make a <i>rough estimate</i> of how much time do we have to give <i>per</i> subject. The problem is that this way of planning is <i>unorganized</i> , but we don\'t have a better alternative, so we stick with it.\n\n
        At best we write the plan on a paper or on a calendar but we know that it <i>lacks flexibility</i>. It is not possible to follow the plan for 10 continuous days ( for some of us it\'s definitely not easy), so we end up switching days, skipping days, and slowly we end up losing track of our plan .\n\n The AI-based exam planner is designed to handle the above-mentioned problems.

        \n\n\n\n
        <b>2. HOW DOES IT WORK ?</b>\n\n


        <i>Steps to create a schedule</i> -\n\n

            <i>Step 1 </i>: pick a date range for which you want to find the schedule\n
            <i>Step 2 </i>: review your subjects and press calculate\n\n

        <i>Steps to customize the schedule</i> -\n\n

            <i>Step 1</i> : long press any subject and move the subject to a new position .\n
            <i>Step 2</i> : drop the subject . The schedule rearranges itself . \n\n


            <i>Replacing a subject</i> -\n\n

            <i>step 1</i> : click on a subject and pick any subject from the list to replace .




        \n\n\n\n
        <b>3. HOW DOES THE ALGORITHM WORK ?</b>\n\n

           Currently , the planner calculates the most consistent schedule . By consistent , we mean that you have to put
           equal effort throughout the schedule . Difficult and easier/ easy subjects are spread equally .

        \n\n\n\n
        <b>4. UPCOMING FEATURES</b>\n\n

            Planning two subjects in a single day and still having the consistency.

    <string name="linear_tracker_instruction">
        <b>How does linear tracker work ?</b>\n\n
        While adding any subject you have to pick a range for which you plan to study that subject. The cursor travels through
        the bar and as it moves forward it blinks faster, thus letting you know that you have less time. The cursor takes a step
        forward every next day.
    </string>

    <string name="cards_instruction">

        <b>How does remember cards work ?</b>\n\n

        Remember card lets you add small notes and you receive these notes as notifications from our servers frequently.\n
        These notifications help in memorizing formulas , key points , equations , terms .\n\n

        <i>How frequently notifications are sent?</i>

        It depends on the <i> card priority</i> you add when you are saving a new \'remember card\' \n\n

        <i>Priority : 1 </i> Get notification every 12 hours\n
        <i>Priority : 2 </i> Get notification every 5 hours\n
        <i>Priority : 3 </i> Get notification every 2 hours\n
        <i>Priority : 4 </i> Get notification every 1 hour\n\n\n

        <b>How does assignments / projects work ?</b>\n\n

        Add the name of your assignment / project and add the deadline. \n
        You will get notifications about the deadline if your assignment is not marked as \'completed\'.\n
        These notifications are sent three , two and one day before the deadline \n
